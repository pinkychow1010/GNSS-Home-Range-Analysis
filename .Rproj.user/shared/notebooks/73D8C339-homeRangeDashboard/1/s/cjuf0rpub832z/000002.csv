     Note 1: As of version 0.2-1, error handling in this 
     package was amended to conform to the usual R protocol. 
     The deldir() function now actually throws an error 
     when one occurs, rather than displaying an error number 
     and returning a NULL.
 
     Note 2:  As of version 0.1-29 the arguments ""col"" 
     and ""lty"" of plot.deldir() had their names changed to 
     ""cmpnt_col"" and ""cmpnt_lty"" respectively basically 
     to allow ""col"" and and ""lty"" to be passed as ""..."" 
     arguments.
 
     Note 3: As of version 0.1-29 the ""plotit"" argument 
     of deldir() was changed to (simply) ""plot"".
 
     See the help for deldir() and plot.deldir().
